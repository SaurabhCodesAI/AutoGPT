🧠 What is VertexAutoGPT?
VertexAutoGPT is a next-generation autonomous AI agent, built entirely from scratch — not a clone, not a fork. It combines modular reasoning, custom model tuning, optimized memory systems, and distributed execution, designed for developers who want full control and ruthless efficiency.

This is not just another wrapper around OpenAI APIs. VertexAutoGPT is a purpose-built system with its own logic, memory, and feedback loops — engineered for measurable, production-grade performance.

⚡ Key Capabilities
✅ Autonomous Execution — Multi-step reasoning with retry/reward loops
✅ Memory-Driven Logic — Hybrid Redis + FAISS architecture for fast + deep recall
✅ Self-Improving — QLoRA fine-tuning pipeline using real JSON-based feedback logs
✅ Toolchain Automation — GitHub commits, file operations, Notion/Markdown integration
✅ Parallel Agent Ops — Ray + Dask for distributed execution
✅ Benchmarkable — Evaluate evolution using memory + planning tests
✅ Cloud-Native Deployment — Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, runs on CPU or GPU nodes

Planning/reasoning scores

Every PR must pass memory + execution tests — this isn’t static code; it's a learning agent.

👨‍💻 Built By
VertexAutoGPT was crafted from scratch — every pipeline, module, and reasoning loop. Inspired by modern agent frameworks, but reimagined for full control, modularity, and performance-first design.
