## 🧠 What is VertexAutoGPT?

**VertexAutoGPT** is a next-generation autonomous AI agent built fully from first principles — no clones, no forks. It combines modular reasoning, custom model tuning, high-performance memory systems, and distributed execution — designed for developers who want full control and zero compromises.

It is not just another wrapper around OpenAI APIs. This is an architected system with its own brains, pipelines, and internal feedback loops.

## ⚡ Key Capabilities

- ✅ **Autonomous Execution** — Executes multi-step tasks with retry/reward loops  
- ✅ **Memory-Driven Reasoning** — Uses Redis + FAISS hybrid memory with prioritization  
- ✅ **Learning from Failure** — QLoRA fine-tuning pipeline based on real feedback logs  
- ✅ **Toolchain Automation** — GitHub commits, file ops, Notion/Markdown updates  
- ✅ **Parallelized Agent Ops** — Ray/Dask for distributed tool invocations  
- ✅ **Benchmarkable** — Tracks evolution via `benchmark.py`  
- ✅ **Cloud-Native Deployment** — Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, and GCP (GPU/CPU)

## 🧪 Benchmarking & Evolution

Track agent performance with `benchmark.py`. Includes:

- ✅ Memory recall tests  
- ✅ Code generation accuracy  
- ✅ Tool invocation success rate  
- ✅ Planning/reasoning scores  

> Every PR must pass memory + execution tests — this is a learning agent, not static code.

## 👨‍💻 Built By

**VertexAutoGPT** was built from scratch — every file, pipeline, and reasoning loop. Not cloned. Not forked. Inspired by modern agents, but designed for control, personalization, and modular evolution.
