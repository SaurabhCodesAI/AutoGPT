# 🧠 AutoGPT – Autonomous AI Agent | Built by SaurabhCodesAI

## 🚀 **Overview**
AutoGPT is a **cutting-edge autonomous AI agent** built for **self-improving decision-making, multi-modal reasoning, and real-world task execution**. Leveraging **fine-tuned LLMs, reinforcement learning, and distributed AI**, this project is engineered for **high-performance automation at scale**.

## ⚡ **Key Features**
✅ **Autonomous AI Execution** – Real-time decision-making & adaptation  
✅ **Custom Fine-Tuned Models** – RLHF, LoRA, and QLoRA optimization  
✅ **Multi-Modal AI** – Handles text, vision, and speech processing  
✅ **Scalable Vector Memory** – FAISS, Redis & AI-driven knowledge retrieval  
✅ **Enterprise-Grade Deployment** – Auto-scaling with Kubernetes & CI/CD
