# 🧠 What is VertexAutoGPT?

**VertexAutoGPT** is a next-generation autonomous AI agent, built entirely from scratch — *not a clone, not a fork*. It combines modular reasoning, custom model tuning, optimized memory systems, and distributed execution — designed for developers who want full control and ruthless efficiency.

This is not just another wrapper around OpenAI APIs. VertexAutoGPT is a purpose-built system with its own logic, memory, and feedback loops — engineered for measurable, production-grade performance.

## 🧪 Benchmarking & Evolution

Track agent development using `benchmark.py`:

- ✅ Memory recall accuracy  
- ✅ Code generation correctness  
- ✅ Tool invocation success rate  
- ✅ Planning and reasoning scores  

> Every pull request must pass memory + execution tests. This isn’t static code — it’s a learning agent.

## 👨‍💻 Built By

VertexAutoGPT was crafted from the ground up — every pipeline, module, and reasoning loop. Inspired by modern agent frameworks, but reimagined for total control, modular evolution, and performance-first architecture.
